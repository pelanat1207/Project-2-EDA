# Project-2-EDA
This project is the secnd assignment required in Data Science Course, Naya College and submitted to the instructor Dror Geva. The project main purpose was to explore and practice the EDA process using PANDAS and MATPLOTLIB. We also used some newer packages (WordCloud, Plotly, pygal, seaborn) to plot data at the best possible way we found to fit the data presentation.
